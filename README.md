Core repository for all research code centered around [Memory Networks](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3916v11.pdf)
for question-answering. This directory is broken up in the following way:

1. BABL Tasks (/babl)
    - Replicate Question-Answering Code from [End-to-End Memory Networks](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.08895v5.pdf)
      on Facebook AI's corpus of [20 BABL Tasks](https://research.facebook.com/researchers/1543934539189348)
